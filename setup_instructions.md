__Hi!__


There are 2 ways to get the materials for this workshop:

1. Clone the GitHub repo, setup the envorniment, and follow along in the Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Follow along on the web.

Option 1 is the best. It allows you to learn through doing"
Setup the environments is still a source of suck. Let's try to do the best we can...
